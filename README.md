This is the code for a modified motorcycle tail lamp with integrated blinkers(turn indicators) and four different modes of 
lighting patterns that can be cycled through with push of a button. All of these patterns can be reprogrammed. 

This was made using programmable LEDs called WS2812B which is programmed and controlled using FastLED library and Arduino.
